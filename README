This repository contains all the assignments implementation of UCSD Object Oriented Programming in Java. 

Course description: This 6 week long course teach you how to build a GUI in Java to show earthquake information using Google map
and add different earthquake features. Learners who have difficult in doing assignment could find this repository
is helpful. For more course informantion, please visit Coursera: https://www.coursera.org/learn/object-oriented-java.

Note: For the week 5 assignment, the instructors requires you extend current UnfoldingMaps GUI based on your intereset. I have uploaded 
a screenshot of my extension on GitHub.

Here is my extension descriptions:
In my extension, I add two features into may Earthquake city map. 
1. The first one is when the user clicks on a city, my map will display a popup menu either on or off the map which displays 
a count for the number of nearby earthquakes and their average magnitude. You can check my screenshot to see this new feature. 
In addition, I also included more information of the clicked city and the earthquake which threat circle contains the city in 
the Eclipse console.
2.The second one is I drew a line between the clicked city and earthquake which is useful for the user to visualize the influence 
of the earthquake.

For the module 6 code deteils:
The main modification and extension I made is in the EarthquakeCitymap class and CityMarker class.
In the checkCitiesForClick() method of EarthquakeCityMap class, if the user clicked on a city, all the earthquakes' threat circle 
that include the city will be recorded and their location information will be added to a array list called lc (store the earthquakes' location information). 
Then, I called the getProperties() method of city marker and returned a HashMap called prop. Then, I will put the earthquake 
information(magnitude, location, threat circle) into the prop which is be used in the cityMarker class. 
In the meantime, I also use System.out.println() command to print out the information of earthquake and city quake in the Eclipse console 
which will be easily read by the user.

In the drawMarker() method of cityMarker class, if the getClicked() is true, I will get the properties of this city marker using getProperties() 
method. Since I have already store the information of threat circle earthquake information so I can use it right now to draw lines 
between city quake and earthquake. Next, I use the ScreenPosition class to convert earthquake location to x, y coordinates in the screen. 
Then, I can use this coordinates to draw lines to show the relationship between city quake and earthquakes.

So this is a general technical description of extensions I have done in this assignment. If anybody have questions about my implementation, 
feel free to open an issue or submit a PR.


=====================================================================================
The following is UCSD MOOC group readme file:
unfolding_app_template and UC San Diego/Coursera MOOC starter code

This is a skeleton to use Unfolding in Eclipse as well as some starter
code for the Object Oriented Programming in Java course offered by 
UC San Diego through Coursera.

A very basic Unfolding demo you'll find in the source folder in the default package. 
For more examples visit http://unfoldingmaps.org, or download the template with
examples.

The module folders contain the starter code for the programming assignments
associated with the MOOC.

Get excited and make things!


INSTALLATION

Import this folder in Eclipse ('File' -> 'Import' -> 'Existing Projects into
Workspace', Select this folder, 'Finish')


MANUAL INSTALLATION

If the import does not work follow the steps below.

- Create new Java project
- Copy+Paste all files into project
- Add all lib/*.jars to build path
- Set native library location for jogl.jar. Choose appropriate folder for your OS.
- Add data/ as src


TROUBLE SHOOTING

Switch Java Compiler to 1.6 if you get VM problems. (Processing should work with Java 1.6, and 1.7)
